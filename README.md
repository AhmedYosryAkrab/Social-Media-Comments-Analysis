# Social-Media-Comments-Analysis
Side project I was involved in year 2019 based on Machine learning approach which helps here in that project to analyze whether the comment left on a post in a social media website is positive or negative opinion for something or someone. The project aim is achieved  by implementing training &amp; testing  of 4 different algorithms which are Logistic regression, SVM, KNN and NN achieving 95.6%, 95.2%, 94.1%, 92.7% accuracies respectively on a personal comments labeled dataset of Twitter users comments from www.kaggle.com consists of 31962 rows of comments, showing a comparison between the percentage of accuracy for each algorithm of them on the same dataset.
